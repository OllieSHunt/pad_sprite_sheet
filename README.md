# What Is This?
This is a Python script for adding padding around all tiles in an existing sprite sheet.

I made this to solve an extremely specific problem I encountered while using the Bevy game engine (see [this](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1949) issue).

# Example usage
```bash
python add_padding.py input.png output.png
```

# Dependencies
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/)
